## Data Wrangling is the process of converting data from the initial format to a format that may be better for analysis.

## How to work with missing data?

#### Steps for working with missing data:

1.Identify missing data
2.deal with missing data
3.correct data format

### Identify and handle missing values

#### Identify missing values
    `Convert "?" to NaN`

-> In the car dataset, missing data comes with the question mark "?". We replace "?" with NaN (Not a Number), which is Python's default missing value marker, for reasons of computational speed and convenience. Here we use the function:
`.replace(A, B, inplace = True)` to replace A by B


##### replace "?" to NaN
`df.replace("?", np.nan, inplace = True)`

#### Evaluating for Missing Data
The missing values are converted to Python's default. We use Python's built-in functions to identify these missing values. ##### There are two methods to detect missing data:

`.isnull()`
`.notnull()`

The output is a boolean value indicating whether the value that is passed into the argument is in fact missing data.
Ex: `missing_data = df.isnull()`
`missing_data.head(5)`   
#check if they're true or false,"True" stands for missing value, while "False" stands for not missing value.


#### Count missing values in each column

`value_counts()` counts the number of "True" values.

`for column in missing_data.columns.values.tolist():
    print(column)
    print (missing_data[column].value_counts())
    print("")    `
    
### Deal with missing data

#### How to deal with missing data?

#### drop data
a. drop the whole row
b. drop the whole column
c.replace data
1. replace it by mean
2. replace it by frequency
3. replace it based on other functions

Note: Whole columns should be dropped only if most entries in the column are empty. 


##### Calculate the average of the column:
ex1: `avg_norm_loss = df["normalized-losses"].astype("float").mean(axis=0)`
print("Average of normalized-losses:", avg_norm_loss)

##### Replace "NaN" by mean value in "normalized-losses" column:
ex2: `df["normalized-losses"].replace(np.nan, avg_norm_loss, inplace=True)`

##### Calculate the mean value for 'bore' column:
ex3: `avg_bore=df['bore'].astype('float').mean(axis=0)`
     print("Average of bore:", avg_bore)
     
##### Replace NaN by mean value
`df["bore"].replace(np.nan, avg_bore, inplace=True)`

##### examples with questions:

1. replace NaN in "stroke" column by mean.
`avg_stroke=df['stroke'].astype('float').mean(axis=0)`
`df['stroke'].replace(np.nan, avg_stroke, inplace=True)`

2. Calculate the mean value for the 'horsepower' column:
`avg_horsepower = df['horsepower'].astype('float').mean(axis=0)`
print("Average horsepower:", avg_horsepower)

3. Replace "NaN" by mean value:
`df['horsepower'].replace(np.nan, avg_horsepower, inplace=True)`

4.Calculate the mean value for 'peak-rpm' column:
`avg_peakrpm=df['peak-rpm'].astype('float').mean(axis=0)`
print("Average peak rpm:", avg_peakrpm)

5.Replace NaN by mean value:
`df['peak-rpm'].replace(np.nan, avg_peakrpm, inplace=True)`

6.To see which values are present in a particular column, we can use the ".value_counts()" method:
`df['num-of-doors'].value_counts()`

7.We can see that four doors are the most common type. We can also use the `.idxmax()` method to calculate for us the most common type automatically:

`df['num-of-doors'].value_counts().idxmax()`

8.replace the missing 'num-of-doors' values by the most frequent 

`df["num-of-doors"].replace(np.nan, "four", inplace=True)`

9. let's drop all rows that do not have price data:

##### simply drop whole row with NaN in "price" column
`df.dropna(subset=["price"], axis=0, inplace=True)`

##### reset index, because we droped two rows
`df.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)`

10. The last step in data cleaning is checking and making sure that all data is in the correct format (int, float, text or other).

In Pandas, we use

`.dtype()` to check the data type

`.astype()` to change the data type

##### Convert data types to proper format examples: 

`df[["bore", "stroke"]] = df[["bore", "stroke"]].astype("float")`
`df[["normalized-losses"]] = df[["normalized-losses"]].astype("int")`
`df[["price"]] = df[["price"]].astype("float")`
`df[["peak-rpm"]] = df[["peak-rpm"]].astype("float")`


## Data Standardization

Data is usually collected from different agencies with different formats. (Data Standardization is also a term for a particular type of data normalization, where we subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation)

### What is Standardization?

Standardization is the process of transforming data into a common format which allows the researcher to make the meaningful comparison.

Example:
Transform mpg to L/100km:
In our dataset, the fuel consumption columns "city-mpg" and "highway-mpg" are represented by mpg (miles per gallon) unit. Assume we are developing an application in a country that accept the fuel consumption with L/100km standard

We will need to apply data transformation to transform mpg into L/100km?
The formula for unit conversion is L/100km = 235 / mpg

ex:

1.   Convert mpg to L/100km by mathematical operation (235 divided by mpg)
`df['city-L/100km'] = 235/df["city-mpg"]`

2.According to the example above, transform mpg to L/100km in the column of "highway-mpg", and change the name of column to "highway-L/100km".
`df.rename(columns={'highway-mpg':'highway-L/100km'},inplace=True)`

## Data Normalization
Normalization is the process of transforming values of several variables into a similar range. Typical normalizations include scaling the variable so the variable average is 0, scaling the variable so the variance is 1, or scaling variable so the variable values range from 0 to 1

Example:
To demonstrate normalization, let's say we want to scale the columns "length", "width" and "height"
Target:would like to Normalize those variables so their value ranges from 0 to 1.
Approach: replace original value by (original value)/(maximum value)

`df['length'] = df['length']/df['length'].max()`
`df['width'] = df['width']/df['width'].max()`

## Binning
Binning is a process of transforming continuous numerical variables into discrete categorical 'bins', for grouped analysis.

Example:
In our dataset, "horsepower" is a real valued variable ranging from 48 to 288, it has 57 unique values. What if we only care about the price difference between cars with high horsepower, medium horsepower, and little horsepower (3 types)? Can we rearrange them into three â€˜bins' to simplify analysis?

We will use the Pandas method `'cut'` to segment the 'horsepower' column into 3 bins

Example of Binning Data In Pandas:
Convert data to correct format

`df["horsepower"]=df["horsepower"].astype(int, copy=True)`

Lets plot the histogram of horspower, to see what the distribution of horsepower looks like.

''' python
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib as plt
from matplotlib import pyplot
plt.pyplot.hist(df["horsepower"])

#set x/y labels and plot title
plt.pyplot.xlabel("horsepower")
plt.pyplot.ylabel("count")
plt.pyplot.title("horsepower bins") '''

We would like 3 bins of equal size bandwidth so we use numpy's  
`linspace(start_value, end_value, numbers_generated)` 
function.

Since we want to include the minimum value of horsepower we want to set
`start_value=min(df["horsepower"])`

Since we want to include the maximum value of horsepower we want to set
`end_value=max(df["horsepower"])`

Since we are building 3 bins of equal length, there should be 4 dividers, so 
`numbers_generated=4`

We build a bin array, with a minimum value to a maximum value, with bandwidth calculated above. The bins will be values used to determine when one bin ends and another begins.

`bins = np.linspace(min(df["horsepower"]), max(df["horsepower"]), 4)`

`group_names = ['Low', 'Medium', 'High']`

We apply the function "cut" the determine what each value of "df['horsepower']" belongs to. 
`df['horsepower-binned'] = pd.cut(df['horsepower']`
`bins, labels=group_names, include_lowest=True )`

## Indicator variable (or dummy variable)
An indicator variable (or dummy variable) is a numerical variable used to label categories. They are called 'dummies' because the numbers themselves don't have inherent meaning.

### Why we use indicator variables?
So we can use categorical variables for regression analysis in the later modules.

Example
We see the column "fuel-type" has two unique values, "gas" or "diesel". Regression doesn't understand words, only numbers. To use this attribute in regression analysis, we convert "fuel-type" into indicator variables.

We will use the panda's method  `'get_dummies'` to assign numerical values to different categories of fuel type.

`dummy_variable_1 = pd.get_dummies(df["fuel-type"])`

#### change column names for clarity 
`dummy_variable_1.rename(columns={'fuel-type-diesel':'gas'`
`'fuel-type-diesel':'diesel'}, inplace=True)`
We now have the value 0 to represent "gas" and 1 to represent "diesel" in the column "fuel-type". We will now insert this column back into our original dataset.

#merge data frame "df" and "dummy_variable_1" 
`df = pd.concat([df, dummy_variable_1], axis=1)`

#drop original column "fuel-type" from "df"
`df.drop("fuel-type", axis = 1, inplace=True)`

##### examples:
1. create indicator variable to the column of "aspiration": "std" to 0, while "turbo" to 1.
#Write your code below and press Shift+Enter to execute 
`dummy_variable_2 = pd.get_dummies(df["aspiration"])`
`dummy_variable_2.rename(columns={'std':'aspiration-std', 'turbo': 'aspiration-turbo'}, inplace=True)`

2. Merge the new dataframe to the original dataframe then drop the column 'aspiration'
`df = pd.concat([df, dummy_variable_2], axis=1)`
`df.drop("aspiration", axis = 1, inplace=True)`

3. save the new csv
`df.to_csv('clean_df.csv')`
